~GameOfLife~

Info: This program was designed to be used via console, so make sure you got an interpreter for php installed!

To start the "Game of Live" (GoL), simply type "php gameoflife.php" into your console, to start a game with a random field. 
If you need help or wish to use more options, enter "php gameoflife.php --help" (or: "php gameoflife.php -h").
You can also combine the different operands, for example: "php gameoflife.php --width 20 --height 10 --maxSteps 5" <-- Will generate a 20x10 field, and show you 5 generations. 

Have fun! :)
